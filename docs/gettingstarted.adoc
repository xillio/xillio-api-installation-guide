= Getting Started

This chapter will provide some first steps to get started with using the Xillio API.
For the complete reference documentation, see https://docs.xill.io.

The examples shown here use the https://curl.haxx.se/download.html[curl] command line tool, which is freely available for many different platforms.
For all examples the default tenant 'tenant' will be used, with 'yourdomain.com' as the domain name.
For your local deployment the Xillio Engine domain name configured in <<network-configuration>> should be used instead.

//TODO : add more chapters here!

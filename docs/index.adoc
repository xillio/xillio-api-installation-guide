= Xillio API Installation Manual
Xillio <support@xillio.com>

Aside from being available in the cloud, the Xillio API can also be installed on-premise. This manual helps you navigate the steps required to install Xillio API on your premises.

NOTE: To complete this manual you *need access to our Docker repositories*.
If you do not yet have this access and are interested in running the Xillio API on-premise, please contact our <<support>>.

The Xillio API can be set up in 2 ways: for a single tenant or for multiple tenants.
The single-tenant mode is generally recommended since it is easier to set up and use.
If secure tenant separation is needed and no custom authorization logic is used, then the multi-tenant mode can be used.
